# Getting-CleaningData-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

-  Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation

-  Load the activity and feature info

-  Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset

-  Merges the two datasets

-  Converts the activity and subject columns into factors

-  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

-  Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.


The end result is shown in the file merge_data_avg_act_sub.txt
